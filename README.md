# satellite-attitude-dynamics
Analysing satellite attitude under disturbance torques to identify stable regimes and implement effective control.

## Overview
- Derived Eulerâ€™s rotational dynamics under disturbance torques.  
- Simulated system response in MATLAB.
- Used dynamical systems tools to analyze whether behaviour is stable or chaotic.
- Applied proportional control to suppress chaotic behaviour.  
- Identified stable regimes for attitude control.

## Results
- Without control: chaotic divergence under disturbance torques
  - Phase Portraits
